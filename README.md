Hii I'm Allex, and I'm registering my journey on programming, by doing a single "Hello World" print everyday :)
I'm starting with python but I'll make other versions for java and C too, but since I'm not doing rn, just starting with the basic python is good1!
I'm also making this acc on github just to register many other activities in my academic life of a Academic Software Engineer >B)
But I'll try to post some funny stuff I would like to share too, so if you follow me in this journey I wish I can make you giggle at least once :3
